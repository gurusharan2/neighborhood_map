<p>Display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in within this neighborhood. This app should displays those locations by default when the page is loaded.

A list view of the set of locations is implemented

<h3> Wikipedia's API.</h3>
<p>A functionality is added using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked. Note that StreetView and Places don't count as an additional 3rd party API because they are libraries included in the Google Maps API.</p>
<h1>#FrameWork:</h1>
<h3>Knockout.</h3>
<p>Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model. Any time you have sections of UI that update dynamically (e.g., changing depending on the userâ€™s actions or when an external data source changes), KO can help you implement it more simply and maintainably. </p>
